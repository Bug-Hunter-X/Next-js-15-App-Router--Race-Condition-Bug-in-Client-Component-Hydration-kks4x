In Next.js 15, a rather uncommon issue arises when using the `app` directory and server components alongside client components that rely on heavy client-side data fetching or complex interactions.  The problem manifests as unexpected behavior or silent failures, particularly when navigating between routes rapidly. This can be challenging to debug because it doesn't always produce clear error messages.  The root cause often lies in race conditions or unhandled promises between server actions and client-side hydration.
